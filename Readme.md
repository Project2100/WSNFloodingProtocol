This is a copy of the WSN simulator "Castalia", with some additional original source code written by me, for the purposes of performing a university assignment. Therefore, I choose to use the Academic option described in the "LICENSE" file as the license for using the simulation software.

### Dependencies

 - OMNeT++ 4.6, found [here](https://omnetpp.org/download/old) 
 - Castalia 3.3, for which there is the official [repo](https://github.com/boulis/Castalia)
